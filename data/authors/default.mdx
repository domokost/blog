I have a passion for technology and more than 15 years of industry experience in
software and enterprise architecture. I have a classic engineering education with 
a strong focus on distributed systems and cloud computing. 

I am currently working as a cloud solution architect and independent consultant.
Previously, I lead the Hungarian team of [One Step Beyond](https://osb.group),
a cloud-native consultancy company. Before that, I was a business solutions architect
[SMP Solutions](https://smp.hu), and for more than
10 years I was working for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/professionalservices/overview)
as a consultant and solution architect.

At the moment, I’m focused on building my new company 
[Tar & Partners Consutling](https://tar.consulting).

For the most part, this site is about solution architecture, engineering,
cloud computing, and home automation.
